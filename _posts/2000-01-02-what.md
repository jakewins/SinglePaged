# What is this?

Open Data is the movement to open up public access to data - and to create awesome things with it. The Columbia Open Data Hackathon is a weekend dedicated to building civic technology, making machines, visualizing, writing, talking and thinking about open data in Columbia Missouri.

Come join us - bring a project, an idea, or just an open mind. The event is non-profit and free to attend, dedicated to encouraging more open data and more usage of it for the benefit of everyone.

The purpose of the event is to help build a community to inspire a local civic technology ecosystem.
