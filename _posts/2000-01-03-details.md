## Format

Friday afternoon, and all of Saturday, will be spent hacking, writing and tinkering, rounding off with a demo on Sunday at 11am. Food will be provided on both Friday and Sunday.

**You can hack on anything that involves open data!** If you think your project should fit in - bring it! You can work on a project you've had brewing for a long time, show up with just an idea or bring nothing but your beautiful mind and find others to work with at the event.

**You get to cheat!** You don't have to start from scratch on the day - bringing an almost-finished project is a-ok!

**You'll find friends!** If you don't know what you'd want to work on, but just like the idea of open data, you should come! We'll help you find a project looking for more able hands. 

## Where is it?

    500 E. Walnut Street, Suite 105
