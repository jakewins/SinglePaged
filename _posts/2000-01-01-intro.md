#### Open Data in Columbia

<h1 class="tron">Open CoMo</h1>

# Was hosted on the 13th and 14th of November 2015


This event is over - but we helped make Columbia better using open local, state or federal data!

There's not a next event planned. 
If you are interested in open data and want to be notified, you can sign up for updates [here](http://goo.gl/forms/qLHgGQnQAQ).
