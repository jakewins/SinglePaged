# Ideas

Build something local for Columbia, for Missouri, for the whole country or the whole world! In other open data hackathons, people have built super cool things and you should totally borrow their ideas :)

Some projects that have grown out of other open data hackathons:

- **[Where 2 Live](https://www.canadianopendataexperience.com/teams/trak)** - ranking the best places to live in Canada
- **[CityGram](https://www.citygram.nyc/)** - For New York, allows residents to designate area(s) of a city they are interested in and subscribe to open data topics.
- **[Squalid Salad](https://www.canadianopendataexperience.com/teams/demofirst)** - uses public health statistics to inform parents of dangers in the home, and how to avoid them
- **[LUP Linkup Point](http://www.lupmobile.com/)** - helps truck drivers find loading docks in the city
- **[Dangerous Roads](http://dangerousroadsnyc.com/)** - an online resource for finding the top bike, car, and pedestrian injuries or fatalities along a route or within a specified area in NYC
- **[Perspective](http://www.thespace.org/artwork/view/hackthespace)** - Using open video of Barack Obama and video editing tools, a "video" of the president giving a speech originally given by Vladimir Putin.
- **[Chair in the sun](http://popmedia.se/produkt/stolen-i-solen-vinnare-open-stockholm-awards-2014/)** - what restaurants have sun on their outdoor seating right now?
- **[Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/organize/)** - We don't have a code for america brigade in columbia - maybe you should found one?

And here are some ideas using local data sets:

- A map of lakes that are safe to swim right now using the [Columbia water quality data](https://www.gocolumbiamo.com/Health/Environmental_Health/lakesamples.php)
- Visualize the [Boone County budget](http://www.showmeboone.com/auditor/budget-2014.asp)
- Show depth maps of rivers to help fishermen using the [MU elevation dataset](http://www.showmeboone.com/auditor/budget-2014.asp)
