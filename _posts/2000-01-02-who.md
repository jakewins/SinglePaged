<h2 style="text-align:left;">Everyone!</h2>

If you have an idea for using open data, want to find an interesting project to contribute towards, learn about how to visualize or analyze data or simply want to see what's happening, then definitely come participate! No matter your skillset or interests, we are encouraging organizers to foster opportunities for you to learn and help the global open data community grow.

<h2 style="text-align:right;">Developers</h2>

We need computer cowboys and cowgirls like yourself to wrangle data into something useful. That means visualization, notification, integration, etc., all in the name of doing something crazy and fantastic.

We need people like you to make the everything look amazing, feel intuitive, and have a smooth user experience. The best application in the world that no one can use... isn't much use! You know the drill.

<h2 style="text-align:right;">Journalists</h2>

We need your inquisitive minds and beaurocracy-traversing skills to get to the nitty-gritty data, analyze it and help people understand it - write an article, make a visualization, join a team to build an app.
